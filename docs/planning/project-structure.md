## folder rules

| folder | responsibility | must not contain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/sweeper/environment` | game state, actions, and replay | agent strategy or hidden-state leaks in observations |
| `src/sweeper/agents` | choosing actions through stable solver/model interfaces | direct mutation of board internals |
| `src/sweeper/solvers` | constraints and mine-risk calculations | presentation or web concerns |
| `src/sweeper/representation` | conversions from visible board state | game-state ownership |
| `src/sweeper/evaluation` | seeded comparisons and metrics | environment-specific behavior |
| `src/sweeper/explanations` | evidence labels and human-readable traces | unverified claims of certainty |
| `src/sweeper/data` | labeled states and data transforms | one-off experiment results |
| `src/sweeper/models` | learnable architectures and losses | dataset splitting policy |
| `configs` | versionable run configuration | secrets or generated output |
| `tests` | automated checks that mirror package areas | production-only utilities |
| `docs` | decisions, plans, and technical references | generated experiment artifacts |

## naming conventions

- Use lowercase `snake_case` for Python modules and configuration files.
- Name a module after one responsibility: `board.py`, `replay.py`, `metrics.py`.
- Keep public package names singular when they represent one domain (`environment`, `evaluation`, `representation`) and plural when they hold many implementations (`agents`, `models`, `solvers`, `explanations`).
- Mirror source paths in tests: `src/sweeper/environment/board.py` pairs with `tests/environment/test_board.py`.
- Store only small, versioned examples in Git. Generated datasets, models, runs, and artifacts stay ignored.

## implementation order

The project starts with `src/sweeper/environment` and `tests/environment`. Other source areas remain empty until their roadmap phase begins.
